# Advent of Code 2024

I've been really enjoying working in the Gleam programming language, so I
thought I'd try to complete all of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
this year in Gleam.

> This project was created using [adglent](https://github.com/JohnBjrk/adglent).

## Running the code

```sh
# Test all days with the example inputs
gleam test

# Get the solution for a specific day
# gleam run -m day{n}/solve {part}, e.g.:
gleam run -m day1/solve 1
```
